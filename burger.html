        <h5>Ingredients:</h5>
        <ul>
            <li>5 fresh jalapeno peppers</li>
            <li>4 pounds ground beef</li>
            <li>1 egg</li>
            <li>salt and pepper to taste</li>
        </ul>
        <h5>Steps:</h5>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat a grill for high heat. When the grill is hot, roast the jalapeno peppers until blackened on all sides. Place in a plastic bag to sweat and loosen the blackened skin. Rub the skin off, then seed if desired, and chop.</li>
            <li>In a large bowl, use your hands to mix together the chopped jalapenos, ground beef, salt, pepper, egg, steak sauce, onion, hot pepper sauce, oregano, Worcestershire sauce, garlic salt and FritosÂ®. Divide into 8 balls, and flatten into patties.</li>
            <li>Grill patties for 10 to 15 minutes, turning once, or until well done. I always drink one beer, then flip, drink another beer, then remove from the grill and place on buns. Top each one with a slice of pepperjack cheese and pig out!</li>
        </ol>
